# Moderation policies

These policies will cover how the administration team will engage in review and address violations of the Code of Conduct and are not themselves rules.

## **1. Reports**

### **1.1. Review of local reports**

When a report is submitted to us from a user on our instance, a moderator / administrator will review the report's reason, additional information provided (if any), and the content of the reported posts / profile.

We will provide a generic outcome of the report in a manual or automated message (sent from @transparency@furry.engineer) outlining the type of action we took on the report.

### **1.2. Review of remote reports**

**All reports received from other instances are anonymous.** As such, we cannot currently send a response on any action we’ve taken.

We will review all reports in the same manner as we review local reports. However, some content may not violate our policies and result in no action being taken, while they may violate the remote instance’s policies. We strongly encourage the use of the block user option in this circumstance.

### **1.3. Review of local reports about remote instances**

Similar to **Section 1.1** *(Review of local reports)*, we will provide a generic outcome of the report in a manual or automated message. However, our rules may differ from the rules of the remote instance.

In such circumstances, we may suspend or limit the scope of posts made by reported users who violate our rules, but that will not affect their ability to continue to make such posts on their own instance.

Additionally, we may take action against the instance as outlined in the [Instance Federation Policy](federation.md) where the nature of the instance indicates such activity is acceptable, is unmoderated, or otherwise ignored.

### **1.4. Appeal of reports**

If you feel we haven’t taken the appropriate action, you can reach out to the Network Owner via **network@pawb.social** to request review of the report.

## **2. Account sanctions**

Consequences for failing to comply with the Code of Conduct may include, at the sole discretion of the moderator:

* A warning (or strike) being recorded against your account;
* Removal of posts or content;
* A temporary freeze or limitation of posting;
* A permanent suspension and termination of account

### **2.1. Warning / Strike**

Warnings (or strikes) will be issued for most violations of the Code of Conduct where a moderator deems the user’s self-corrective action (removing and reposting) or understanding of the rules is sufficient.

No further action will be taken and reports against the user / posts will be considered resolved.

Users issued a warning are expected to comply immediately with any corrective action, even if they disagree; failure to do so may be seen as bad-faith and result in an escalation of consequences.

### **2.2. Removal of posts or content**

Typically this will occur in conjunction with another action, where the user has not self-corrected the violation or the content needs to be removed expeditiously.

### **2.3. Temporary freeze / limit on posting**

Moderators have the ability to temporarily freeze accounts which restricts the user’s ability to create, favorite, or boost posts. This will occur for more severe violations of the Code of Conduct or for repeated violation of the rules.

We may also temporarily freeze an account if there are repeated violations within a short period of time that require immediate intervention. This may be downgraded to a warning in such circumstances once corrective action is taken.

### **2.4. Permanent suspension / termination of account**

We will only terminate accounts if there is a gross violation of the Code of Conduct, continued violations after a temporary freeze, or the user demonstrates a lack of willingness to follow the Code of Conduct.

Termination results in deletion of the user’s profile, posts, uploads, followers, and other data after a period of 30 days from permanent suspension.

### **2.5. Appeals**
Users may submit **one appeal** for each moderation action taken against their account.

Appeals can be submitted using the link provided in the moderation action email, and should include as much information as possible. Supplemental information can be sent by emailing it to **network@pawb.social**, with your account username and `“Additional appeal information”` in the subject line. 

Appeals against moderation actions will be reviewed by an administrator not involved with the original decision, or the Network Owner. **The outcome of the appeal, once decided, will be considered final.**

The appeal administrator will review the content and original reports, as well as the appeal message and any internal moderator notes before coming to their decision. If we have any concerns or questions, we will reach out via DM (or via email to the email address on your profile, if your account is frozen or suspended).
