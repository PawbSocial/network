# Pawb.Social Code of Conduct and Policies

The Pawb.Social administration team wants to create and foster a diverse, welcoming community, and a safe space where those within the LGBTQ+ community can be themselves.

This Code of Conduct applies to all services run by Pawb.Social, including furry.engineer and pawb.fun, any media or files uploaded by users to any of our services, as well as in any private communication conducted on or through any of our services.

## **Rules**

By utilizing any of our services, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and breaking it may result in sanctions against your account.

### **1. Illegal content or conduct**
Content or conduct that is illegal in the United States is strictly prohibited. Pawb.Social services are operated and maintained within the United States and all content must comply with the federal laws of the United States.

For the avoidance of doubt, this includes but is not limited to: Instructions on how to commit crimes, encouraging acts of violence or terrorism, child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or depictions thereof, and unauthorized access or exploitation of computer systems.

### **2. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other discrimination is prohibited**
We take a hard stance against any form of discrimination or abuse towards users in our community. Users who engage in such conduct are not welcome on our platform.

### **3. Don’t stalk or harass other users**
Respect other users of our service and other federated instances. If someone doesn’t want anything to do with you, leave them alone. Attempts to bypass blocks, including creating alternate accounts for that purpose, is prohibited.

“**Screenshot dunking**”, or the act of taking screenshots of posts to repost and harass without directly replying, is strongly discouraged. If someone is annoying you, harassing you, or a genuine danger to other users, block and report them.

### **4. Misinformation and deceptive content is prohibited**
Misinformation, scams, Ponzi schemes, and other deceptive tactics have become rampant on other platforms and we don’t want to see a resurgence of it in the Fediverse.

Examples of prohibited content include, but are not limited to, the following: COVID and health misinformation, pro-insurrection (Jan 6th) comments or endorsement, NFTs, “crypto” (blockchain & tokens, NOT cryptography), MLMs / pyramid schemes, flat earth claims.

### **5. CW: Content warning policies**
Content warnings are a way of hiding content behind a short, inoffensive message that allows users to know before they click to view the content. 

This helps users avoid certain uncomfortable topics they don’t want to see, or would otherwise be inappropriate for them to open in a given environment. For example: Accidentally opening a NSFW image at the grocery store.

> Example of a post with a content warning on Mastodon web v4.0.2.

#### **5.1. Content that _requires_ a CW**
Posts originating on Pawb.Social instances must comply with the CW policies listed below. For exceptions that may apply to locked accounts, see **Rule 5.4** *(CW Exception: Locked and follower-only posts)*.

As some posts boosted by users originate on other instances, we understand there may be differences in policies regarding the usage of content warnings. For that reason, we won’t take action against our users that boost content without a CW, but may apply moderation actions against the post, such as marking as sensitive or deletion in severe circumstances.

**Content warnings required by this section must be added through the CW system built into Mastodon**; simply using the text “CW” but leaving the content visible is not acceptable. On the web client, this is by clicking the “CW” button under the post textbox, and will vary on mobile clients but typically use “CW” or a warning triangle.

##### **5.1.1. CW: NSFW content without a CW**
Any NSFW content, including real or artistic (digital or otherwise), must be behind a content warning message.

NSFW content includes, but is not limited to: nudity, sex, kink, and the discussion of such.

###### **CW Message Format**
> Ideally, your CW should start with “NSFW” (case-insensitive) and include a rough summary of the type of content.

##### **5.1.2. CW: Political discussion and debate without a CW**
Political discussions and debates, due to the polarizing and sensitive nature of both subjects, must be behind a content warning message.

Discussions of politics can be emotionally destabilizing and distressing to others given recent political events.

**However, content promoting and supporting marginalized groups, or activism towards positive social change, such as BLM, trans rights, LGBTQ+ rights, are exempt from this rule. Additionally, the expression of identity and lived experience do not fall under the category of ‘political discussion’ for the purposes of this rule.**

Per **Rule 2** *(Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other discrimination is prohibited)*, any content containing political rhetoric against a marginalized group is expressly prohibited and will not be tolerated.

###### **CW Message Format**
> Ideally, your CW should start with “Pol” or “Politics” (case-insensitive) and include a rough summary of the topic.
>
> For country-specific politics, we recommend adding a country-tag in your CW message. For example, “US pol” or “USPol” (case-insensitive) for US-related politics discussions.

##### **5.1.3. CW: Religious promotion and debate without a CW**
Promotion, endorsement, and debates on religion, due to the polarizing and sensitive nature, must be behind a content warning message. Self-expression of religious or spiritual beliefs are exempt from this rule.

However, per **Rule 2** *(Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other discrimination is prohibited)*, harassment and abuse towards any user based on their religious or spiritual preference (inc. Atheism) is expressly prohibited and will not be tolerated.

###### **CW Message Format**
> Ideally, your CW should start with “Rel” or “Religion” (case-insensitive) and include a rough summary of the topic.

##### **5.1.4. CW: Drugs without a CW**
Posts and boosts discussing Schedule I or II substances or topics of substance abuse, must be behind a content warning message.

Discussion about the use of scheduled substances may still constitute a violation of **Rule 1** *(Illegal content or conduct)* if it is found to be encouraging use (or misuse, in cases of substances with safe and accepted medical uses), or attempting to engage in a sale or transfer of prohibited or scheduled substances.

###### **CW Message Format**
> Ideally, your CW should start with “Drugs” (case-insensitive) and include a rough summary of the topic.

##### **5.1.5. CW: Graphic depictions of injuries with blood and gore**
Posts and boosts about and media containing graphic depictions of injuries that include blood and gore must be behind a content warning and must be marked as sensitive media.

###### **CW Message Format**
> Ideally, your CW should start with or contain “Graphic injury”, “injury, blood”, “injury, gore”, or any combination of such to clearly indicate the severity. We strongly recommend that little, if any, context is added to the CW message to avoid breaking **Rule 5.2** *(CW: Sensitive content in CW message)*.

#### **5.2. CW: Sensitive content in CW message**
When creating a content warning message, please do not put any polarizing or graphic content into the message.

For example, don’t use `“NSFW, <long graphic explanation of how hard and well you can do sexual intercourse>”`, instead use something like `“nsfw, m/m, con-noncon, bondage, long video”` – Basically, explain the content behind the warning, without painting a detailed picture.

#### **5.3. Content that we _recommend_ a CW**
For these categories, we would prefer that posts and boosts use a content warning, but are not required.

These are recommendations that provide a better experience to all users on our service and other federated instances by allowing them to opt-out of viewing such content.

While we won’t take action against accounts that don’t mark these types of content, you may end up blocked by other users or limited on other instances which may have stricter rules.

##### **5.3.1. Spoilers**
When a new movie, game, or other media comes out, everyone gets excited. However, for example, having the ending of a game spoiled before you’ve even got to enjoy it really sucks. So we strongly recommend that any potential spoilers are behind a CW to give everyone the same enjoyment.

###### **Suggested CW Message Format**
> Your CW should start with, or contain, “Spoiler” (case-insensitive) and include a rough summary of the media it’s a spoiler about. For example: “Spoiler: OneShot game ending.”

##### **5.3.2. Topics around mental health**
Topics around mental health can be fatiguing to users also suffering from mental health issues, so it’s recommended and appreciated for such topics to be behind a CW, but is not required.

###### **Suggested CW Message Format**
> Your CW should contain “MH”, “MH-”, “MH+” or other similar indication, and optionally an additional summary at your discretion.

#### **5.4. CW Exception: Locked accounts and follower-only posts**
If your account is marked as requiring follow requests (Settings → Profile → Appearance), it is acceptable to omit explicit content warnings and marking as sensitive media on your posts under these conditions:

- Your account is marked as “Require follow requests”; and
All posts omitting a CW required under **Rule 5.1** *(5.1. Content that requires a CW)* are marked as “Followers only”; and
- You have an appropriate warning in your profile description about the lack of CWs and a general guide on what kind of CW topics you post (e.g. “NSFW”, “porn”, etc.)

### **6. Respect the service**
Do not perform any manual or automated penetration testing against our production services without prior written approval which can be obtained by contacting us at `network@pawb.social`.

Spam and advertising is not acceptable, but friendly automated bots are welcome. Where possible, try to restrict any recurring automated posts to Unlisted to avoid cluttering the Local and Federated timeline.

Use of automated tools on the service is permitted for personal use, where such tools do not impact the performance of the services. 

Additionally, the use of automated tools by, or on behalf of, archival organizations (such as WaybackMachine) are permitted when limited in scope. For example, archiving a user’s profile or a specific toot. For larger scopes, please contact us at `network@pawb.social` for approval and assistance.

### **7. Use the report system**
If a user or instance is breaking the rules, we recommend just reporting the content and not engaging. We don’t want users to end up getting caught in the crossfire for attempting to correct a user in good faith, as this makes our jobs significantly harder.

Additionally, the team is here to help – If you’re unsure on a particular post, user profile, instance, etc. and don’t think we’ve seen or dealt with it yet, please send in a report. No user will ever be penalized for genuine use of the report system.

### **8. AP: Account policies**

#### **8.1. Posting language**
While English is the primary language of the instance, we have no restrictions on the languages that can be used. However, we do require that all posts are properly marked with the language used, which can be done at the account level through the account preferences page, or per-post by clicking the language button next to “CW” (Content Warning).

Setting the correct language allows users to utilize the built-in LibreTranslate system to translate posts to their preferred language, and assists the moderation team with addressing concerns raised by other users.

#### **8.2. Misleading or deceptive impersonation**
You may not impersonate an individual, group, or organization with the intent to deceive, confuse, and exploit other users.

However, it is not a violation of this rule to impersonate for the purposes of parody, commentary, or fan accounts, so long as such accounts remain respectful and abide by the Code of Conduct. Parody accounts should tag themselves clearly in their profile description.

#### **8.3. Bot accounts**
Bot accounts must be marked as a bot using the “This is a bot account” option under Profile → Appearance.

Bots must post using either “Unlisted”, “Followers only”, or “Mentioned people only”, so we can keep the local and federated timelines clear and focused on users.

Bots must be made to heed the API rate-limits and should have a minimal impact on the instance performance.

All bots are expected to refuse to communicate, scrape, or otherwise access profiles with the “#NoBot” (case-insensitive) tag in their profile.

Restrictions on posts and interactions with users do not apply to official, administrative use bots.

#### **8.4. Brand and Government-affiliated accounts**
No brand or government-affiliated account may be registered on Pawb.Social services without prior written and publicly recorded approval, except furry fandom-operated brands and events covered by the exception below. This approval may be revoked by Pawb.Social at any time for any reason.

Brand and Government-affiliated accounts and instances must post using either “Unlisted”, “Followers only”, or “Mentioned people only”, so we can keep the local and federated timelines clear and focused on users. Remote users and dedicated instances violating this rule will be limited and their content only available to followers and through boosts.

However, furry fandom-operated brands and events are exempt from this rule as we want to encourage and support business within the fandom. This rule may be revised at a later date dependent on the future volume impact on the public timelines.

#### **8.5. Bypassing suspension**
If you have been suspended from any Pawb.Social instance, you may not create another account on any of our services.

#### **8.6. Inappropriate avatar or header image**
All avatars and header images must not contain any content that is prohibited by any other rule in the Code of Conduct, especially content that requires a Content Warning.
