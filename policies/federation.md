# Instance federation policy

We are an open-first instance, however in rare cases where an instance has been identified as being, indifferent to, permissive of, or actively encouraging abusive conduct, that instance will be blocked from federation.

## **1. Limitation on federation**

Limiting an instance will make posts from accounts on that instance invisible to anyone that isn’t following them and as such those posts will not show up in the Federated timeline.

This may occur to instances that have non-severe rule-breaking content and have a significant following from our services, or in circumstances where instances cater solely to content warned content but do not enforce CWs.

We may also utilize limit / silence features on remote accounts that violate our Code of Conduct, such as unmarked bot accounts, bot posts in the public timeline, or not utilizing the CW system.

## **2. Suspension on federation**

Suspending an instance will result in being unable to follow any users on that instance or see any posts from it. All existing content from suspended instances will be purged.

We try to avoid entirely suspending and defederating instances where possible, and use it as a last resort. However, we will not federate with instances that court, encourage, or lack moderation policies to deal with harassment, abuse, discrimination, or illegal content.

## **3. Appeal on defederation**

All users can view the list of instances we’ve taken action against on the about page of each of our instances, along with a public reason and the severity of the action. Newly sanctioned instances will be additionally posted to the [@transparency@furry.engineer](https://furry.engineer/@transparency) account under the **#FediBlock** hashtag.

If an instance has been suspended for harassment, abuse, discrimination, or illegal content, don’t bother appealing. We will not respond or engage with any contact attempts. Our users are not being subject to that.

Otherwise, you can email **network@pawb.social** with the subject line `“{domain} - Defederation review”` and include a comprehensive explanation of the conduct accused in the publicly listed reason. If you’re unsure of what conduct constituted the violation, we’d be more than happy to provide links and engage in discussion.
