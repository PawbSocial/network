# Mastodon instance covenant

This is a codified version of the official server covenant located at https://joinmastodon.org, that we commit to following:

### **1. Active moderation against racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia**

We will ensure that our rules are kept up-to-date and explicitly prohibit any form of discrimination, harassment, hate, and abuse. We agree to uphold those rules and keep our users safe against abhorrent conduct.

### **2. Daily backups**

We will maintain a minimum of 14 days active rolling backup to prevent the loss of user content and data. We will also maintain the last 3 backups of every month for long-term recovery of content in case of a catastrophic failure.

### **3. At least one other person with emergency access to the server infrastructure**

We will maintain a small trusted team of system administrators who have access to the server infrastructure, either physically or remotely.

### **4. Commitment to give users advance warning in case of shutting down**

We will provide at least 90 days advance warning in the event that we are unable to continue supporting the service to allow users to export their data and find a new instance.
