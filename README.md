# Pawb.Social Network

Welcome to the Pawb.Social network repository! Here we house our code of conduct, policies, concerns and suggestions raised by the community, and the source code for the pawb.social website.

We're creating a network of instances aimed at providing a safe and welcoming place for those within the furry fandom and LGBTQ+ community, and currently operate two instances: https://furry.engineer and https://pawb.fun.

## Current Service Status

You can find the latest status info for all of our pawb.social services at https://status.pawb.social.

## Donate

Donations can be made directly to @crashdoom (the network owner) through our Ko-fi and go towards things like hosting costs and hardware upgrades to keep the service running smoothly.
